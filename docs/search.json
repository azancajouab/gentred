    "text": "Among the major social changes of the 21st century are the processes of urban transformation and socio-spatial configuration. Globalization has accelerated processes of fragmentation and social polarization, with particularly strong effects in urban settings. The cities of the 21st century are the sites where the contradictions of globalization—between growth and inequality—are most sharply concentrated. They have become the operational centers of increasingly interconnected economic relations and are practically the only visibly localized part of a highly delocalized economy, more virtual than physical in its projection. Globalization and polarization have occurred simultaneously, even in the cities of countries with strong welfare systems. The rise in social inequality and the limitations of governments in addressing it have contributed to worsening residential segregation in major cities.\nThe increase in economic inequality and residential segregation in global cities has coexisted with processes of urban gentrification in several areas. Gentrification refers to the process by which socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods undergo reinvestment and reversal, often involving the arrival of middle- and upper-middle-class populations. This frequently leads to increases in housing and service costs, potentially resulting in the displacement and replacement of existing residents. The social consequences of neighbourhood transformation in terms of economic inequality, social and community cohesion, and the consumption patterns of different social groups are a growing area of academic and political interest. There has been considerable debate on whether the effects of gentrification are positive or negative in terms of social opportunities, urban development, and social cohesion. However, the educational field has been relatively under-researched—especially in Spain. Available studies on the educational implications of gentrification have shown that increased social heterogeneity does not necessarily lead to improved academic outcomes or reduced school segregation. On the contrary, they often identify adverse or unintended effects in terms of educational equity. In such neighbourhoods, these consequences seem linked to the activation of specific socio-spatial strategies within educational markets by these “new residents,” which can lead to school exclusion, “school gentrification,” and other practices aimed at the social reproduction of these groups. More research is needed to understand the impact of these urban transformations on educational inequality dynamics."

    "text": "Strand 1. Impact on school segregation and social stratification: a quasi-experimental design\nBased on the objectives of the PX and DA, three main dimensions of impact will be analysed: 1) school segregation, 2) concentration, and 3) social stratification between public and private schools.\nThe design characteristics of the PX and DA do not make it possible to apply quasi-experimental research designs involving natural experiment approaches or the comparison of similar groups. The most suitable quasi-experimental design to estimate the causality between their implementation and the evolution of school segregation is Interrupted Time Series (ITS) regression analysis – a particularly appropriate method for universal interventions or policy designs that do not allow for the identification of a control group (Lopez-Bernal, 2017). Figure 2 summarises the ITS model proposed to analyse the impact of both policies. It is hypothesised that the implementation of the PX in the school year 2019/20 produced a decrease in school segregation, concentration, and social stratification, and that this decreasing trend will even increase because of the implementation of the DA in 2021/22 and the effects produced by the interaction of these two complementary policies."

    "text": "Strand 2. Context-Mechanisms-Outcomes (CMOs): realist analysis of desegregation policies\nThe second methodological strand of the project aims to unveil how and why the two policies analysed work. To do so, the research project relies on a Context-Mechanisms-Outcomes (CMOs) approach, which is informed by the ontological and epistemological assumptions of theory-based policy evaluation, and of a realist approach in particular (Pawson & Tilley, 2004).\nThis approach assumes that policy interventions are embedded in social systems and work selectively, as they have effects depending on how people make them work. Accordingly, a realist perspective aims to capture actors’ enactment (interpretation and translation) of public policies, as well as opening the black box between policy interventions and impacts by taking into account the mediating role of the context (Astbury & Leeuw, 2010). A realist approach thus allows us to provide a more sophisticated understanding of what, how, and why PX and DA work, for whom and under what circumstances.\nThe operationalisation of the methodological approach proposed consists of breaking down an intervention into different CMOs pattern configurations that explain how policy instruments operate.\n\nContext: Includes all features and conditions in which programmes are introduced, considering that “interventions, by definition, are always inserted into pre-existing conditions” and therefore influenced by contextual constraints (Pawson, 2006: 24).\nMechanisms: Understood as the “engines of explanation in realist analysis” (Pawson, 2006: 23), describe how programmes are expected to bring particular effects.\nOutcomes: Comprise the intended and unintended consequences of programmes resulting from the activation of different mechanisms in diverse contexts."

    "text": "Project summary\n\nSchool segregation is currently one of the greatest educational and social challenges facing European countries and cities. The fight against school segregation has direct implications for the right to education, children’s well-being, the quality of public services, and social cohesion. The city of Barcelona ranks among the Catalan cities with the highest levels of school segregation, despite also being a pioneer in developing local policies to mitigate this issue. In this context, and with the goal of addressing this challenge, the Barcelona Education Consortium launched the “Shock Plan Against School Segregation” in 2018, a groundbreaking and innovative initiative at the European level aimed at significantly reducing school segregation in the city through a wide range of measures. More recently, the approval of the new Admissions Decree by the Generalitat of Catalonia in 2021 has helped to strengthen this policy, establishing a regulatory framework that consolidates many of the measures outlined in the Shock Plan, while also introducing new instruments to improve the distribution of socially vulnerable students.\n\n\nThe main objective of this project is to determine the impact of the Shock Plan and the Admissions Decree on the distribution of socially vulnerable students across educational centers in the city of Barcelona, as well as to analyze the functioning of the various instruments introduced by these policies. The project aims to capture not only the effect of the education policy on school segregation but also how these policies are interpreted and influence the behavior of educational centers and families, and how their impact varies depending on the social, geographic, and educational context.With this objective, and by combining two complementary methodological approaches (impact evaluation and realist evaluation), the project aims to provide evidence for political decision-making and the fight against school segregation.\n\n\nSchool segregation is currently one of the greatest educational and social challenges facing European countries and cities.

The quantitative phase includes the following methods and techniques:\n\nStatistical analysis of student registers and school pre-registration databases provided by the Consorci d’Educació de Barcelona (CEB) -the Local Education Authority-, enabling comparison of sociodemographic and educational characteristics of both school supply and demand.\nSocio-spatial analysis techniques using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to estimate retention and exit levels of different student profiles in various neighbourhoods, as well as changes in the geographic attraction capacity of school offerings.\nQuasi-experimental evaluation methods, which help estimate changes in impact dimensions caused by gentrification.\n\nIn the qualitative phase, GENTRED adopts an “embedded single case study” strategy—that is, the study of a single case through multiple units of analysis: families and school actors in neighbourhoods with divergent gentrification processes. This approach is combined with “critical case sampling” to help capture the underlying mechanisms of the phenomenon. The qualitative instruments include:\n\nDocument analysis: thematic analysis of school projects and internal documents, as well as content analysis of websites, promotion strategies, and open school days sessions.\nInterviews: semi-structured interviews with headteachers, teachers, and families at selected schools.\nParticipant observation during open days events, meetings between teachers and families, and other school life spaces."
